# Hero, Villain, and Victim : Semantic role labelling of entities

## Introduction

The project is done as part of and dataset provided by https://constraint-lcs2.github.io/.
We aim to project a particular entity as either hero, villain or victim based on the context it is mentioned in. We create and build multiple models for the share task analysis.
The models are based on extracting visual and textual context of entity, aligning them with entity itself and using the shared feature vector for labelling.
